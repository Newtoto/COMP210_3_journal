## Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes
(http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7363283)
Goes over some controllers, and VR interfaces. Tested 2 game prototypes and controllers. Mentions motion sickness, but jumps to the conclusion of it being down to one game being action, but neglets to mention how the player moves about in either of the games, I cannot find gameplay on this.

- Find action games which teleport causing less motion sickness.
- Find puzzle games which move causing more motion sickness.

## Exploitation of heuristics for virtual environments
(https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2399065)
Explores various ways of conducting heuristic analysis on virtual reality, and how existing methods have been combined for the new medium. Issues can be divided into 2 main categories, display related, and interactivity. A patchwork of heuristics like some of the papers have used has been suggested to uncover problems. This patchwork would be based on the context and the emphasis. Using these bespoke hueristics, issues can then be categorised into them. Some of Nielsen's heuristics were used, but 5 categories didn't have problems associated with them in this context. Heuristics are adapted to needs. Set up for a formal framework which allows heuristics to be tailored to needs but also formalised.

## Investigating the balance between virtuality and reality in mobile mixed reality UI design: user perception of an augmented city
(https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2641201)
Ran a field study of 35 people, and a survey of over 100 testing where the best balance between reality and UI is. 3D rendering appeared to offer more clarity and usability, but the camera live view gave more utility, understandabilty and significanly more pleasantness.
3D model didn't have things like loads of traffic blocking visibility, you can tailor the experience more, considered better for weaker eye sight. Real camera better for finding places, and getting additional info. Users tended to hold their phone lower due to social awkwardness. 3D model could be used in this position, but the camera not so much. Enjoyed just panning with gestures and not moving whole body. Both views have uses, so allow for switching, one wasn't considerably better than the other at everything.

## Homuncular Flexibility in Virtual Reality.

The way someone percieves their own body can be changed based on sensory input. In the case of VR this means that if they see they have a different skill set, different limbs etc... they will then act accordingly after time. Body transfer can be experienced when you thing you embody something that you don't.

Rubber hand illusion is referenced (stroking rubber hand at the same time as yours makes you embody that hand) - neuroplasticity

took less than 10 minutes to change the way they moved

sense of being may be mistaken for being able to control the avatar fluently - link to languages?

embodiment may be present in non immersive media

increase immersion with more feedback
